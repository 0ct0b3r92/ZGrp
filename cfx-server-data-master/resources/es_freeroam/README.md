2. Extract the folder and rename it to es_freeroam
3. Place the folder in your resources/[essential] folder
4. Change **resource_type 'map' { gameTypes = { fivem = true } }**   
to    
**resource_type 'map' { gameTypes = { es_freeroam = true } }**  
in your fivem-map-skater or fivem-map-hipster resource.lua file.

## Upgrade
Since the last upgrade we integrated the vehicle shop directly in es_freeroam.
